### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have **Go** installed ([Install Go](https://go.dev/)).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyBiblio.git
   cd MyBiblio
   ```

### Steps to Run
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
2. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Testing Guide

MyBiblio implements a secure JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control (RBAC). The system includes comprehensive input validation and error handling.

### 1. Database Setup
Ensure PostgreSQL is running and your `.env` file contains:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=mybiblio
DB_PORT=5432
DB_SSL=disable
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_secret_key
```

### 2. Available Roles
The system supports four roles with different permissions:
- **Admin**: Full access to all features
- **Manager**: Can manage books, authors, and view reports
- **Employee**: Can manage customers and orders
- **User**: Can browse books and manage their own orders

### 3. Testing with Postman

#### Step 1: User Registration and Authentication

1. **Register Users** (Create a request for each role)
   - Method: `POST`
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/register`
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Body (Admin):
     ```json
     {
         "name": "Admin User",
         "email": "admin@mybiblio.com",
         "password": "adminpass123",
         "role": "admin"
     }
     ```
   - Body (Manager):
     ```json
     {
         "name": "Manager User",
         "email": "manager@mybiblio.com",
         "password": "managerpass123",
         "role": "manager"
     }
     ```
   - Similar for "employee" and "user" roles

2. **Login** (Test each user)
   - Method: `POST`
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/login`
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
         "email": "admin@mybiblio.com",
         "password": "adminpass123"
     }
     ```
   Save the returned token for each user.

#### Step 2: Testing Role Permissions

Create these requests in Postman and test with different user tokens:

1. **Admin Tests** (Should all succeed)
   ```http
   # Create Book
   POST http://localhost:8080/books
   Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
       "title": "Test Book",
       "author": {
           "id": 1,
           "first_name": "Test Author",
           "last_name": "Test"
       },
       "genres": "Fiction",
       "price": 29.99,
       "stock": 100
   }

   # Delete User
   DELETE http://localhost:8080/users/2
   Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

   # View Reports
   GET http://localhost:8080/sales-reports
   Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
   ```

2. **Manager Tests**
   ```http
   # Create Book (Should succeed)
   POST http://localhost:8080/books
   Authorization: Bearer <manager_token>
   
   # Delete User (Should fail)
   DELETE http://localhost:8080/users/2
   Authorization: Bearer <manager_token>
   ```

3. **Employee Tests**
   ```http
   # View Customers (Should succeed)
   GET http://localhost:8080/customers
   Authorization: Bearer <employee_token>
   
   # Create Book (Should fail)
   POST http://localhost:8080/books
   Authorization: Bearer <employee_token>
   ```

4. **User Tests**
   ```http
   # View Books (Should succeed)
   GET http://localhost:8080/books
   Authorization: Bearer <user_token>
   
   # Create Order (Should succeed)
   POST http://localhost:8080/orders
   Authorization: Bearer <user_token>
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
       "customerID": 1,
       "items": [
           {
               "bookID": 1,
               "quantity": 2
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

### Expected Test Results
